# Logic Prototype

A single, self-contained HTML file (a **shareable demo**) that lets anyone drive a state model by clicking buttons. Use this when the question is about **business logic, state transitions, or data shape**: the kind of thing that looks reasonable on paper but only feels wrong once you push it through real cases.

Because it's one file with nothing to install, you can hand it to a non-developer (a designer, a PM, a domain expert) and let them feel the model for themselves. So it speaks their language, not the code's.

## When this is the right shape

- "I'm not sure if this state machine handles the edge case where X then Y."
- "Does this data model actually let me represent the case where..."
- "I want to feel out what the API should look like before writing it."
- Anything where someone wants to **press buttons and watch state change**.

If the question is "what should this look like," this is the wrong branch. Use [UI.md](UI.md).

## Process

### 1. State the question

Before writing code, write down what state model and what question you're prototyping. One paragraph, at the top of the demo (in a visible intro, not just a comment). Scope the model strictly to that single question so it can be checked later, whether the user is watching now or returning to it AFK.

Done when the state model and the single question being tested are written as a visible one-paragraph intro at the top of the demo.

### 2. Isolate the logic in a portable module

Put the actual logic (the bit that's answering the question) in a single `<script>` block written as a small, pure module that could be lifted out and dropped into the real codebase later. The page around it is throwaway; this module isn't.

The right shape depends on the question:

- **A pure reducer**: `(state, action) => state`. Good when actions are discrete events and state is a single value.
- **A state machine**: explicit states and transitions. Good when "which actions are even legal right now" is part of the question.
- **A small set of pure functions** over a plain data type. Good when there's no implicit current state, just transformations.
- **A class or module with a clear method surface** when the logic genuinely owns ongoing internal state.

Pick whichever shape best fits the question being asked, *not* whichever is easiest to wire to a page. Keep it pure and in-memory (unless persistence itself is the question): zero DOM or `document` references, zero external database or network calls, and zero speculative generalisation beyond the question from step 1. The page is a thin shell that calls into the module; nothing flows the other direction, and the interactive scenarios in the HTML page validate the behaviour directly in place of a test suite. Once the question is answered, the validated reducer / machine / function set lifts into the real module on its own.

Done when the state model lives in a self-contained, in-memory pure `<script>` module with zero DOM references, external dependencies, or speculative generalisation.

### 3. Build the shareable HTML file

One file, plain HTML/CSS/JS: no framework, no bundler, no server, everything inline so it opens by double-click and survives being emailed around. Anyone should be able to run it by opening it.

Write it for a non-developer. Every label is in **domain language**, not code: buttons and state read like the business, not the reducer. Explain in plain words what's happening.

Lay it out with a clean hierarchy, top to bottom:

1. **Title and one-line explanation** of what this demo lets you explore (the question from step 1).
2. **Current state**: the full relevant state, rendered as a readable panel (labelled fields, not a raw JSON dump), re-rendered after every click so the change is visible. Where it helps a non-developer follow, call out what just changed.
3. **Free-play buttons**: one button per action, always available, so anyone can poke at the model in any order. Each click dispatches its action and re-renders the state.
4. **Guided walkthroughs**: a set of **scenarios**, one per tab. Each tab holds a short plain-language description of the scenario (the situation it sets up and what to watch for) and underneath it, the ordered **buttons to press** for that scenario. Each step is a real button: clicking it performs that action and moves to the next step. Starting a walkthrough resets to a known initial state so the scenario runs the same way every time.

Choose scenarios that demonstrate the awkward cases, the ones hard to reason about on paper: the happy path, a tricky edge case, an attempt at something that should be illegal.

Keep it beautiful but restrained: clean typography, generous spacing, one accent colour. No animations, no gimmicks: nothing that competes with the state and the buttons.

Done when the single inline HTML file opens directly in a browser and renders the intro, readable current-state panel, domain-labelled free-play buttons, and resettable guided scenario walkthroughs.

### 4. Hand it over

Send them the file, or open it for them. They'll click through the walkthroughs and free-play whenever they get to it; the interesting moments are when they say "wait, that shouldn't be possible" or "huh, I assumed X would be different"; those are the bugs in the _idea_, which is the whole point. If they want new actions or a new scenario, add them. Prototypes evolve.

Done when the shareable HTML file is delivered or opened for the user and any discovered model edge cases or requested scenarios have been iterated on.

### 5. Capture the answer and the prototype

Once the prototype has answered its question, capture the answer, then capture the prototype the way the [SKILL](../SKILL.md) describes. The logic-specific mapping: only the validated pure reducer / machine / function set lifts into the real production module (the decision, absorbed); the interactive HTML shell rides along only to the throwaway branch that keeps the prototype as a primary source, where it stays trivially re-runnable as a single self-contained file.

Done when the validated pure logic module is lifted into the real codebase, the answer is recorded, and the HTML shell is archived on the throwaway prototype branch out of production.
